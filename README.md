# jfx-eclipse
This program is developed entirely in the Java language in which a simple representation of the sky during a lunar eclipse is shown. 
This program shows the static moon and the sun in movement causing the eclipse, as the sky darkens, the stars appear twinkling. 
The user can interact with the simulation, starting and stopping it at a given moment, and changing the speed of the process.
